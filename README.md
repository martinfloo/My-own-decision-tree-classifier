# My-own-decision-tree-classifier

This project was a part of course in machine learning with my friend Braghe. I will remove his last name and mine for anonymity.

This will work on any binary classification project where you can specify pruning to be TRUE/FALSE. Use ecaluate_.py to run the classifier.
