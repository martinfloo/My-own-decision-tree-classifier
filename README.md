# My-own-decision-tree-classifier

This project was a part of course in machine learning with my friend Brage. I will remove his last name and mine for anonymity.

This will work on any binary classification problem with the possibility to prune. 

Use ecaluate_.py to run the classifier.

Possible improvements: 
- print out the tree structure
- make a function to show feature importance.
